Introduction

Pegasus is a state-of-the-art Transformer model developed by Google for abstractive text summarization. 
It leverages a novel pre-training objective tailored to summarization tasks and achieves high accuracy on popular datasets.

This project showcases how to:
1.Load and preprocess your dataset for summarization.
2.Fine-tune or use a pre-trained Pegasus model.
3.Evaluate the quality of generated summaries using standard metrics like ROUGE.
4.Demonstrate how to generate summaries for new, unseen text.

1. Importing Dependencies
 * PyTorch and Transformers for training and model inference.
 * Pandas and NumPy for data handling

2. Data Loading and Preprocessing
   * Data Source: "cnn_dailymail"
   * Cleaning: Include steps like lowercasing, removing special characters, etc.
   * Tokenization: Uses the Pegasus tokenizer  to transform text into token IDs.

 3. Model Setup
   * Model Selection: Demonstrates how to download and configure a Pegasus checkpoint .
   * Hyperparameters: Configures the model (batch size, learning rate, maximum input length, etc.)

 4. Training
    * Training Loop: Fine-tunes the Pegasus model on the training data.
    * Checkpointing: Saves model checkpoints for later evaluation or inference.
    * Monitoring: Tracks losses or intermediate metrics across epochs.
   
5. Evaluation
   * Metrics: Typically ROUGE (ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L) to quantify summary quality.
   * Validation: Evaluates the model performance on a held-out validation dataset
